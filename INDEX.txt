            <h2>Blood Donation Types</h2>
            <p class="description">Giving the "right" type of blood donation - based on your blood type and patient
                needs -
                helps ensure the
                best use of your valuable contribution. Here are some things to consider when determining how you can
                have
                the most impact.</p>

                    <h2>Whole Blood Donation</h2>
                    <p class="description">Whole blood is the most flexible type of donation. It can be transfused in
                        its original form, or
                        used
                        to help multiple people when separated into its specific components of red cells, plasma and
                        platelets.</p>

                <div>
                    <h2>Power Red Donation</h2>
                    <p class="description"> During a Power Red donation, you give a concentrated dose of red cells, the
                        part of your blood
                        used
                        every day for those needing transfusions as part of their care. This type of donation uses an
                        automated
                        process that separates your red blood cells from the other blood components, and then safely and
                        comfortably returns your plasma and platelets to you.

                        With just a little extra time at your appointment, you can donate more red cells and increase
                        your
                        impact on patients in need.</p>

                <div>
                    <h2>Platelet Donation</h2>
                    <p class="description">Platelets are tiny cells in your blood that form clots and stop bleeding.
                        Platelets are most
                        often
                        used by cancer patients and others facing life-threatening illnesses and injuries.

                        In a platelet donation, an apheresis machine collects your platelets along with some plasma,
                        returning your red cells and most of the plasma back to you. A single donation of platelets can
                        yield several transfusable units, whereas it takes about five whole blood donations to make up a
                        single transfusable unit of platelets.

                        Platelets are collected at Red Cross donation centers only, and are not collected at blood
                        drives.

                    <h2>Plasma Donation</h2>
                    <p class="description">During an AB Elite donation, you give plasma, a part of your blood used to
                        treat patients in
                        emergency situations. AB plasma can be given to anyone regardless of their blood type. Plasma is
                        collected through an automated process that separates plasma from other blood components, then
                        safely and comfortably returns your red blood cells and platelets to you. AB Elite maximizes
                        your
                        donation and takes just a few minutes longer than donating blood.

                        Plasma is collected at select Red Cross donation centers</p>
